The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.

		                                                         ErrEn                     read-write            0              0     1 Register field ErrEn enables the probe to send on the ObsTx output any packet with Error status, independently of filtering mechanisms, thus constituting a simple supplementary global filter.
		                                                         TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                         PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                         StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                         StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                         IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                         FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.

The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.

		                                                         TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                         PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                         StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                         StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                         IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                         FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

		                                                         TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                         PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                         StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                         StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                         IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                         FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

		                                                           StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                           AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                           StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                           IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                           FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

		                                                           ErrEn                     read-write            0              0     1 Register field ErrEn enables the probe to send on the ObsTx output any packet with Error status, independently of filtering mechanisms, thus constituting a simple supplementary global filter.
		                                                           TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                           PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                           StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                           AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                           StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.

		                                                           TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                           PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                           StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                           AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                           StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                           IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                           FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

		                                                           ErrEn                     read-write            0              0     1 Register field ErrEn enables the probe to send on the ObsTx output any packet with Error status, independently of filtering mechanisms, thus constituting a simple supplementary global filter.
		                                                           TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                           PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                           StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                           AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                           StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                           IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode

		                                                         TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                         PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                         StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                         StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                         IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                         FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

		                                                         ErrEn                     read-write            0              0     1 Register field ErrEn enables the probe to send on the ObsTx output any packet with Error status, independently of filtering mechanisms, thus constituting a simple supplementary global filter.
		                                                         TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                         PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                         StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                         StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                         IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                         FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.

The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.

The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.

		                                                         TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                         PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                         StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                         StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                         IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                         FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

		                                                         ErrEn                     read-write            0              0     1 Register field ErrEn enables the probe to send on the ObsTx output any packet with Error status, independently of filtering mechanisms, thus constituting a simple supplementary global filter.
		                                                         TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                         PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                         StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                         AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                         StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                         IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                         FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

		                                                           ErrEn                     read-write            0              0     1 Register field ErrEn enables the probe to send on the ObsTx output any packet with Error status, independently of filtering mechanisms, thus constituting a simple supplementary global filter.
		                                                           TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                           PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                           StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                           AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                           StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                           IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                           FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                           AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.

This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                           IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                           FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.

		                                                           ErrEn                     read-write            0              0     1 Register field ErrEn enables the probe to send on the ObsTx output any packet with Error status, independently of filtering mechanisms, thus constituting a simple supplementary global filter.
		                                                           TraceEn                    read-only            1              1     1 Register field TraceEn enables the probe to send filtered packets (Trace) on the ObsTx observation output.
		                                                           PayloadEn                 read-write            2              2     1 Register field PayloadEn, when set to 1, enables traces to contain headers and payload. When set ot 0, only headers are reported.
		                                                           StatEn                    read-write            3              3     1 When set to 1, register field StatEn enables statistics profiling. The probe sendS statistics results to the output for signal ObsTx. All statistics counters are cleared when the StatEn bit goes from 0 to 1. When set to 0, counters are disabled.
		                                                           AlarmEn                   read-write            4              4     1 When set, register field AlarmEn enables the probe to collect alarm-related information. When the register field bit is null, both TraceAlarm and StatAlarm outputs are driven to 0.
		                                                           StatCondDump              read-write            5              5     1 When set, register field StatCondDump enables the dump of a statistics frame to the range of counter values set for registers StatAlarmMin, StatAlarmMax, and AlarmMode. This field also renders register StatAlarmStatus inoperative. When parameter statisticsCounterAlarm is set to False, the StatCondDump register bit is reserved.
		                                                           IntrusiveMode              read-only            6              6     1 When set to 1, register field IntrusiveMode enables trace operation in Intrusive flow-control mode. When set to 0, the register  enables trace operation in Overflow flow-control mode
		                                                           FiltByteAlwaysChainableEn read-write            7              7     1 When set to 0, filters are mapped to all statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Therefore, only filter events mapped to even counters can be counted using a pair of chained counters.When set to 1, filters are mapped only to even statistic counters when counting bytes or enabled bytes. Thus events from any filter can be counted using a pair of chained counters.
